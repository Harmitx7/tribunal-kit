## [2.4.0] — 2026-03-05

### Added
- **7 New Skills & Workflows**: `trend-researcher`, `ui-ux-researcher`, `whimsy-injector`, `workflow-optimizer`, `test-result-analyzer` (skills) and `/api-tester`, `/performance-benchmarker` (workflows).
- **CLI Auto-Update**: `tribunal-kit update` now automatically checks the npm registry and re-invokes with `@latest` when a newer version is available. No more manual cache clearing.
- **`--skip-update-check` Flag**: Bypass auto-update for CI/CD environments.

### Changed
- **Enhanced GEMINI.md**: Added 4 new request classification rows (Design/UX, API Testing, Performance, Test Analysis) and 2 new slash commands.

## [2.3.0] — 2026-03-03

### Added
- **Swarm / Supervisor Orchestration**: Introduced a multi-agent orchestration engine (`/swarm`) that decomposes complex goals into parallel specialist sub-tasks via a strict JSON contract.
- **Specialized Tribunal Panels**: Added focused workflows for `/tribunal-mobile` (logic + security + mobile UX) and `/tribunal-performance` (algorithmic complexity + memory + I/O).
- **Interactive Session State**: Enhanced `session_manager.py` with `status`, `tag`, `list`, and `export` commands for persistent task tracking across sessions.
- **Automated Skill-Script Integration**: Upgraded `skill_integrator.py` with `--report` and `--verify` flags for automated validation of skill-to-script mappings and syntax health.

---

## [2.2.0] — 2026-03-02

### Added
- **10 New Specialist Skills**: Added explicitly scoped Tribunal-integrated rulesets for `vue-expert`, `csharp-developer`, `dotnet-core-expert`, `python-pro`, `sql-pro`, `react-specialist`, `devops-engineer`, `devops-incident-responder`, `platform-engineer`, and `agent-organizer`.



---

## [2.0.0] — 2026-02-23

### Added
- **Framework Hardening & Gap Filling**: Implemented missing Python scripts for linting (`lint_runner.py`), testing (`test_runner.py`), security scanning (`security_scan.py`), dependency analysis (`dependency_analyzer.py`), schema validation (`schema_validator.py`), and bundle analysis (`bundle_analyzer.py`).
- **New Workflows**: Introduced Refactor (`/refactor`), Migrate (`/migrate`), Audit (`/audit`), Fix (`/fix`), Changelog Generation (`/changelog`), and Interactive Session (`/session`).
- **New Specialist Agent**: Added `mobile-reviewer` for dedicated React Native, Flutter, and mobile web code audits, bringing the total reviewer count to 9.
- **Skill Integrator**: Added `skill_integrator.py` to automatically detect and map which skills have executable scripts associated with them.
- **New Skill**: Added `config-validator` skill for self-validation of the `.agent` directory.
- **Enhanced Frontend Skills**: Upgraded design frameworks including `frontend-design`, `mobile-design`, `web-design-guidelines`, `nextjs-react-expert`, and `tailwind-patterns` to incorporate cutting edge spatial UI, generative UI, and AI-driven interface patterns.

### Changed
- **Skill Files Rewrite**: Systematically completely rewrote all 37 `SKILL.md` files to utilize a new voice, structure, and headers, preventing copyright claims while maintaining original functionality.
- Upgraded the `/ui-ux-pro-max` workflow to utilize the latest cutting-edge design methodologies.
