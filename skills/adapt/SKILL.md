# Adapt — Responsive Adaptation & Container Queries

## Mandatory Pre-Flight Context Inspection

Before generating, refactoring, or reviewing code in the `adapt` domain, inspect these 5 critical parameters:

1. **System Boundaries & Dependencies**: Verify that all required dependencies exist in target package manifests and environment paths.
2. **Runtime Context & Platform Invariants**: Confirm target platform constraints (Node.js, Browser, Mobile OS, Edge runtime) before applying APIs.
3. **Execution Guardrails**: Identify potential side-effects, state mutations, and unhandled asynchronous exceptions.
4. **Validation & Type Contracts**: Validate input data schemas and strict type constraints across all module interfaces.
5. **Observability & Proof of Execution**: Ensure execution produces tangible verification signals (terminal output, tests, metrics).

## Activation Boundaries

- **Activate when:** Use when Adapt designs across breakpoints, devices, platform constraints, touch vs mouse input, and container queries. Use when making a UI responsive or optimizing for mobile/tablet.
- **DO NOT activate when:** The task falls outside the `adapt` domain or is managed by a different dedicated specialist.

## 🔁 Multi-Pass Execution Protocol

Execute all non-trivial tasks through this 7-pass cognitive loop:

| Pass       | Phase            | Core Action                                                                                  |
| :--------- | :--------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Pass 1** | **Understand**   | Deconstruct the user's explicit objective, implicit requirements, and platform constraints.  |
| **Pass 2** | **Plan**         | Decompose the task into smallest logical steps; map dependencies and required tool calls.    |
| **Pass 3** | **Execute**      | Implement the solution with production-grade craft, zero placeholders, and strict typing.    |
| **Pass 4** | **Verify**       | Run linters, unit tests, or compiler checks to validate structural correctness.              |
| **Pass 5** | **Attack**       | Perform an adversarial review searching for edge-case failures, race conditions, and traps.  |
| **Pass 6** | **Improve**      | Eliminate discovered friction, optimize performance, and harden error boundaries.            |
| **Pass 7** | **Quality Gate** | Enforce Verification-Before-Completion (VBC) with concrete terminal proof before finalizing. |

## 4 Adaptation Mechanics

### 1. Container Queries (`@container`) over Viewport Media Queries (`@media`)

- Components should adapt based on their parent container's width, NOT the global browser window size:

```css
.card-container {
  container-type: inline-size;
}

@container (min-width: 400px) {
  .card-layout {
    display: grid;
    grid-template-columns: 120px 1fr;
  }
}
```

### 2. Touch Target Sizing (Min 44x44px)

- Interactive targets on mobile/touch interfaces MUST maintain a minimum tap target size of `44x44px` (or `48x48px` for Android), even if the visual icon is smaller (`16px`).

### 3. Drawer on Mobile -> Modal on Desktop

- Complex popovers or dialogs on mobile screens should render as bottom sheets (drawers) with drag-to-dismiss handles, automatically morphing into centered modals on desktop viewports ($\ge 768\text{px}$).

### 4. Fluid Typography & Spacing

- Use `clamp()` for fluid scaling without abrupt media query jumps:
  $$\text{FontSize} = \text{clamp}(1\text{rem}, 0.8\text{rem} + 1\text{vw}, 1.75\text{rem})$$

| :------------------------------------- | :--------------------------------------------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Empty or Null Inputs**               | Unhandled exception or unexpected rendering collapse | Enforce fallback guards, optional chaining, and explicit empty state handlers   |
| **Network Timeout / Latency**          | Hanging operations or duplicate side-effects         | Implement bounded abort controllers, exponential backoff, and idempotency keys  |
| **Concurrency / Race Conditions**      | Stale state overwrite or inconsistent data mutations | Use atomic transactions, mutex locking, or cancel-on-resubmit controls          |
| **Invalid Schema / Malformed Payload** | Downstream runtime errors or security injection      | Validate boundary payloads with Zod/Pydantic schemas prior to execution         |
| **Resource / Memory Saturation**       | OOM errors, frame drops, or memory leaks             | Clean up listeners, cancel active timers, and enforce pagination/virtualization |

| **Hallucinated Tool Capabilities** | Assuming an external library or CLI command exists without verification   | Run a verification check or verify package.json before referencing tools |
| **Premature Completion Claim**     | Declaring a task finished because code was generated without verification | Execute tests, linters, or terminal commands to provide concrete proof   |
| **Context Bloat Dumping**          | Pasting entire multi-thousand-line files into prompt context              | Extract targeted excerpts, symbols, and signatures to preserve tokens    |

### ✅ Pre-Flight Self-Audit Checklist

```
✅ Did I deconstruct the root objective before proposing architecture?
✅ Did I identify dependencies, bottlenecks, and parallelizable sub-tasks?
✅ Did I avoid over-engineering and select the simplest effective pattern?
✅ Did I verify assumptions with concrete file reads instead of speculation?
✅ Did I establish measurable verification criteria before completion?
```

### 🛑 Verification-Before-Completion (VBC) Protocol

**CRITICAL:** You must follow a strict "evidence-based closeout" state machine.

- ❌ **Forbidden:** Declaring a task complete because the output "looks correct."
- ✅ **Required:** You are explicitly forbidden from finalizing any task without providing **concrete evidence** (terminal output, passing test suites, compiler success, or equivalent operational proof) that your output works as intended.
