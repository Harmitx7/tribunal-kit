# GitHub Operations — Git & CI/CD Workflow Mastery

---

## Branching Strategy

### Trunk-Based Development (Recommended)

```
main ────●────●────●────●────●────●────●──→
          \  /      \  /      \  /
           \/        \/        \/
        feat/auth  fix/typo  feat/dashboard

Rules:
- main is always deployable
- Feature branches live < 2 days
- Merge via squash PR
- Deploy on every merge to main
- Use feature flags for incomplete features
```

### Git Flow (For Released Software)

```
main     ────●──────────────●──────────●──→
              \            / \        /
develop  ──●───●──●──●──●───●──●──●──●──→
            \  / \    /       \  /
             \/   \  /         \/
          feature  release   hotfix

Use when:
- Versioned releases (mobile apps, libraries, SDKs)
- Multiple environments (staging, production)
- Long-lived feature development
```

## Commit Messages

### Conventional Commits

```
type(scope): description

Body (optional): WHY this change was made, not WHAT

Closes #123

Types:
  feat:     New feature
  fix:      Bug fix
  docs:     Documentation only
  style:    Formatting, whitespace (not CSS)
  refactor: Code change that neither fixes nor adds
  perf:     Performance improvement
  test:     Adding or updating tests
  chore:    Build process, dependencies
  ci:       CI/CD changes

Examples:
✅ feat(auth): add OAuth2 Google login
✅ fix(cart): prevent negative quantities
✅ docs(api): add pagination examples to README
✅ refactor(users): extract validation to separate module
✅ perf(search): add database index for full-text queries
✅ chore(deps): upgrade React to v19

❌ BAD:
❌ "fixed stuff"
❌ "wip"
❌ "updates"
❌ "asdf"
❌ "final fix (for real this time)"
```

### Breaking Changes

```
feat(api)!: rename /users endpoint to /accounts

BREAKING CHANGE: The /api/v1/users endpoint has been renamed to
/api/v1/accounts. All clients must update their API calls.

Migration:
- Replace all /api/v1/users → /api/v1/accounts
- Update API documentation
```

## Pull Request Best Practices

```markdown
## PR Template

### What
Brief description of what this PR does.

### Why
Why is this change needed? Link to issue/ticket.

### How
Technical approach. What was the design decision?

### Testing
- [ ] Unit tests added/updated
- [ ] Manual testing completed
- [ ] E2E tests passing

### Screenshots (if UI change)
Before | After
--- | ---
![before](url) | ![after](url)

### Checklist
- [ ] Self-reviewed the diff
- [ ] No console.log/debugger statements
- [ ] Types are correct (no `any`)
- [ ] Error cases handled
- [ ] Documentation updated (if needed)
```

```
PR Rules:
1. < 400 lines changed (split larger PRs)
2. One logical change per PR
3. Write a clear title (not "fix things")
4. Link the issue/ticket
5. Self-review before requesting reviews
6. Respond to reviews within 24h
7. Squash merge to main (clean history)
```

---

## Common Git Operations

### Interactive Rebase

```bash
# Clean up messy commits before merge
git rebase -i HEAD~3

# In the editor:
pick abc1234 feat(auth): add login endpoint
squash def5678 fix typo in login
squash ghi9012 add missing test

# Result: One clean commit instead of three

# ❌ HALLUCINATION TRAP: Never rebase commits that are already pushed/shared
# Rebasing rewrites history → force push needed → breaks others' branches
# Only rebase LOCAL, unpushed commits
```

### Merge Conflict Resolution

```bash
# Step 1: Update your branch
git fetch origin
git rebase origin/main

# Step 2: When conflicts appear
# Open conflicted files, look for:
<<<<<<< HEAD
your changes
=======
their changes
main

# Step 3: Resolve, stage, continue
git add resolved-file.ts
git rebase --continue

# If things go wrong:
git rebase --abort  # undo everything, back to before rebase
```

### Stash

```bash
# Save work without committing
git stash push -m "WIP: auth feature"

# List stashes
git stash list

# Apply and remove
git stash pop

# Apply without removing
git stash apply stash@{0}
```

### Undo Mistakes

```bash
# Undo last commit (keep changes staged)
git reset --soft HEAD~1

# Undo last commit (keep changes unstaged)
git reset HEAD~1

# Undo last commit (discard changes) ⚠️ DESTRUCTIVE
git reset --hard HEAD~1

# Undo a specific commit (creates a new commit)
git revert abc1234

# Recover deleted branch
git reflog                    # find the commit
git checkout -b recovered abc1234
```

---

## Branch Protection Rules

```yaml
# Recommended rules for main branch:
Required:
  - Require pull request before merging
  - Require at least 1 approval
  - Dismiss stale reviews on new push
  - Require status checks to pass (CI)
  - Require branches to be up to date
  - Require signed commits (optional, enterprise)

Recommended:
  - Restrict who can push (no direct push to main)
  - Require linear history (squash merge)
  - Auto-delete head branches after merge
```

---

## Git Hooks (Husky + lint-staged)

```json
// package.json
{
  "scripts": {
    "prepare": "husky"
  },
  "lint-staged": {
    "*.{ts,tsx}": ["eslint --fix", "prettier --write"],
    "*.{json,md,yml}": ["prettier --write"]
  }
}
```

```bash
# .husky/pre-commit
npx lint-staged

# .husky/commit-msg
npx commitlint --edit $1
```

```javascript
// commitlint.config.js
export default {
  extends: ["@commitlint/config-conventional"],
};
```

## 🤖 LLM-Specific Traps

AI coding assistants often fall into specific bad habits when dealing with this domain. These are strictly forbidden:

1. **Over-engineering:** Proposing complex abstractions or distributed systems when a simpler approach suffices.
2. **Hallucinated Libraries/Methods:** Using non-existent methods or packages. Always `// VERIFY` or check `package.json` / `requirements.txt`.
3. **Skipping Edge Cases:** Writing the "happy path" and ignoring error handling, timeouts, or data validation.
4. **Context Amnesia:** Forgetting the user's constraints and offering generic advice instead of tailored solutions.
5. **Silent Degradation:** Catching and suppressing errors without logging or re-raising.

---

## 🏛️ Tribunal Integration (Anti-Hallucination)

**Slash command: `/review` or `/tribunal-full`**
**Active reviewers: `logic-reviewer` · `security-auditor`**

### ❌ Forbidden AI Tropes

1. **Blind Assumptions:** Never make an assumption without documenting it clearly with `// VERIFY: [reason]`.
2. **Silent Degradation:** Catching and suppressing errors without logging or handling.
3. **Context Amnesia:** Forgetting the user's constraints and offering generic advice instead of tailored solutions.

### ✅ Pre-Flight Self-Audit

Review these questions before confirming output:
```
✅ Did I rely ONLY on real, verified tools and methods?
✅ Is this solution appropriately scoped to the user's constraints?
✅ Did I handle potential failure modes and edge cases?
✅ Have I avoided generic boilerplate that doesn't add value?
```

### 🛑 Verification-Before-Completion (VBC) Protocol

**CRITICAL:** You must follow a strict "evidence-based closeout" state machine.
- ❌ **Forbidden:** Declaring a task complete because the output "looks correct."
- ✅ **Required:** You are explicitly forbidden from finalizing any task without providing **concrete evidence** (terminal output, passing tests, compile success, or equivalent proof) that your output works as intended.
