# Animation Standards Reference

The precise values, curves, and rules behind the review. Cite these in findings instead of approximating. Distilled from Emil Kowalski's design engineering philosophy ([animations.dev](https://animations.dev/)).

## Should it animate? (frequency table)

| Frequency | Decision |
| --- | --- |
| 100+ times/day (keyboard shortcuts, command palette) | No animation. Ever. |
| Tens of times/day (hover effects, list navigation) | Remove or drastically reduce |
| Occasional (modals, drawers, toasts) | Standard animation |
| Rare / first-time (onboarding, feedback, celebrations) | Can add delight |

**Never animate keyboard-initiated actions** — they repeat hundreds of times daily; animation makes them feel slow and disconnected. 
Valid purposes for motion: spatial consistency, state indication, explanation, feedback, preventing jarring change. "It looks cool" on a frequently-seen element is not valid.

## Easing

Decision order:
- Entering or exiting → **`ease-out`** (starts fast, feels responsive)
- Moving / morphing on screen → **`ease-in-out`**
- Hover / color change → **`ease`**
- Constant motion (marquee, progress) → **`linear`**
- Default → **`ease-out`**

**Never `ease-in` on UI.** It starts slow, delaying the exact moment the user is watching. `ease-out` at 200ms *feels* faster than `ease-in` at 200ms.

Built-in CSS easings are too weak. Use strong custom curves:
```css
--ease-out: cubic-bezier(0.23, 1, 0.32, 1);        /* strong ease-out for UI */
--ease-in-out: cubic-bezier(0.77, 0, 0.175, 1);    /* strong ease-in-out for on-screen movement */
--ease-drawer: cubic-bezier(0.32, 0.72, 0, 1);     /* iOS-like drawer curve (Ionic) */
```

## Duration

| Element | Duration |
| --- | --- |
| Button press feedback | 100–160ms |
| Tooltips, small popovers | 125–200ms |
| Dropdowns, selects | 150–250ms |
| Modals, drawers | 200–500ms |
| Marketing / explanatory | Can be longer |

**Rule: UI animations stay under 300ms.** A 180ms dropdown feels more responsive than a 400ms one. 

## Physicality

- **Never `scale(0)`.** Start from `scale(0.9–0.97)` + `opacity: 0`. Nothing in the real world appears from nothing.
- **Origin-aware popovers.** Scale from the trigger, not center.
- **Button press feedback.** `transform: scale(0.97)` on `:active`, `transition: transform 160ms ease-out`. Subtle (0.95–0.98).

## Springs

Feel natural because they simulate physics; no fixed duration. Use for drag with momentum, interruptible gestures.
```js
// Apple-style (easier to reason about) — recommended
{ type: "spring", duration: 0.5, bounce: 0.2 }
```
Keep bounce subtle (0.1–0.3); avoid bounce in most UI. 

## Interruptibility

CSS **transitions** can be interrupted and retargeted mid-animation; **keyframes** restart from zero. For anything triggered rapidly, transitions are smoother.
```css
/* Interruptible — good for dynamic UI */
.toast { transition: transform 400ms ease; }

/* Not interruptible — avoid for dynamic UI */
@keyframes slideIn { from { transform: translateY(100%); } to { transform: translateY(0); } }
```

Use `@starting-style` for entry without JS.
