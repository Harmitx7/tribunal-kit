# Hugging Face API Tool Builder

## Mandatory Pre-Flight Context Inspection
Before reading, generating, or refactoring code in the `huggingface-tool-builder` domain, inspect these 5 critical parameters:
1. **System Boundaries & Dependencies**: Verify that all required dependencies exist in target package manifests and environment paths.
2. **Runtime Context & Platform Invariants**: Confirm target platform constraints (Node.js, Browser, Mobile OS, Edge runtime) before applying APIs.
3. **Execution Guardrails**: Identify potential side-effects, state mutations, and unhandled asynchronous exceptions.
4. **Validation & Type Contracts**: Validate input data schemas and strict type constraints across all module interfaces.
5. **Observability & Proof of Execution**: Ensure execution produces tangible verification signals (terminal output, tests, metrics).


## Activation Boundaries
- **Activate when:** Use when Use this skill when the user wants to build tool/scripts or achieve a task where using data from the Hugging Face API would help. This is especially useful when chaining or combining API calls or the task will be repeated/automated. This Skill creates a reusable script to fetch, enrich or process data.
- **DO NOT activate when:** The task falls outside the `huggingface-tool-builder` domain or is managed by a different dedicated specialist agent.


## 🔁 Multi-Pass Execution Protocol

| Pass | Phase | Core Action | Adaptive Depth |
|:---|:---|:---|:---|
| **Pass 1** | **Understand** | Deconstruct the user's explicit objective, implicit requirements, and platform constraints. | Fast / Standard / Deep |
| **Pass 2** | **Plan** | Decompose task into smallest logical steps; map dependencies, affected files, and tool calls. | Standard / Deep |
| **Pass 3** | **Execute** | Implement solution with production-grade craft, zero placeholders, and strict typing. | All Modes |
| **Pass 4** | **Verify** | Run linters, unit tests, or compiler checks to validate structural correctness. | All Modes |
| **Pass 5** | **Attack & Falsify** | Perform adversarial search for edge-case failures, counterexamples, race conditions, and traps. | Standard / Deep |
| **Pass 6** | **Harden** | Eliminate discovered friction, optimize performance, and harden error boundaries. | Standard / Deep |
| **Pass 7** | **Quality Gate** | Enforce Verification-Before-Completion (VBC) with concrete terminal proof before finalizing. | All Modes |


Your purpose is now is to create reusable command line scripts and utilities for using the Hugging Face API, allowing chaining, piping and intermediate processing where helpful. You can access the API directly, as well as use the `hf` command line tool. Model and Dataset cards can be accessed from repositories directly.

## Script Rules

Make sure to follow these rules:
 - Scripts must take a `--help` command line argument to describe their inputs and outputs
 - Non-destructive scripts should be tested before handing over to the User
 - Shell scripts are preferred, but use Python or TSX if complexity or user need requires it.
 - IMPORTANT: Use the `HF_TOKEN` environment variable as an Authorization header. For example: `curl -H "Authorization: Bearer ${HF_TOKEN}" https://huggingface.co/api/`. This provides higher rate limits and appropriate authorization for data access.
 - Investigate the shape of the API results before commiting to a final design; make use of piping and chaining where composability would be an advantage - prefer simple solutions where possible.
 - Share usage examples once complete.

Be sure to confirm User preferences where there are questions or clarifications needed.

## Sample Scripts

Paths below are relative to this skill directory.

Reference examples:
- `references/hf_model_papers_auth.sh` — uses `HF_TOKEN` automatically and chains trending → model metadata → model card parsing with fallbacks; it demonstrates multi-step API usage plus auth hygiene for gated/private content.
- `references/find_models_by_paper.sh` — optional `HF_TOKEN` usage via `--token`, consistent authenticated search, and a retry path when arXiv-prefixed searches are too narrow; it shows resilient query strategy and clear user-facing help.
- `references/hf_model_card_frontmatter.sh` — uses the `hf` CLI to download model cards, extracts YAML frontmatter, and emits NDJSON summaries (license, pipeline tag, tags, gated prompt flag) for easy filtering.

Baseline examples (ultra-simple, minimal logic, raw JSON output with `HF_TOKEN` header):
- `references/baseline_hf_api.sh` — bash
- `references/baseline_hf_api.py` — python
- `references/baseline_hf_api.tsx` — typescript executable

Composable utility (stdin → NDJSON):
- `references/hf_enrich_models.sh` — reads model IDs from stdin, fetches metadata per ID, emits one JSON object per line for streaming pipelines.

Composability through piping (shell-friendly JSON output):
- `references/baseline_hf_api.sh 25 | jq -r '.[].id' | references/hf_enrich_models.sh | jq -s 'sort_by(.downloads) | reverse | .[:10]'`
- `references/baseline_hf_api.sh 50 | jq '[.[] | {id, downloads}] | sort_by(.downloads) | reverse | .[:10]'`
- `printf '%s\n' openai/gpt-oss-120b meta-llama/Meta-Llama-3.1-8B | references/hf_model_card_frontmatter.sh | jq -s 'map({id, license, has_extra_gated_prompt})'`

## High Level Endpoints

The following are the main API endpoints available at `https://huggingface.co`

```
/api/datasets
/api/models
/api/spaces
/api/collections
/api/daily_papers
/api/notifications
/api/settings
/api/whoami-v2
/api/trending
/oauth/userinfo
```

## Accessing the API

The API is documented with the OpenAPI standard at `https://huggingface.co/.well-known/openapi.json`.

**IMPORTANT:** DO NOT ATTEMPT to read `https://huggingface.co/.well-known/openapi.json` directly as it is too large to process. 

**IMPORTANT** Use `jq` to query and extract relevant parts. For example, 

 Command to Get All 160 Endpoints

```bash
curl -s "https://huggingface.co/.well-known/openapi.json" | jq '.paths | keys | sort'
```

Model Search Endpoint Details

```bash
curl -s "https://huggingface.co/.well-known/openapi.json" | jq '.paths["/api/models"]'
```

You can also query endpoints to see the shape of the data. When doing so constrain results to low numbers to make them easy to process, yet representative.

## Using the HF command line tool

The `hf` command line tool gives you further access to Hugging Face repository content and infrastructure. 

```bash
❯ hf --help
Usage: hf [OPTIONS] COMMAND [ARGS]...

  Hugging Face Hub CLI

Options:
  --help                Show this message and exit.

Commands:

```

The `hf` CLI command has replaced the now deprecated `huggingface-cli` command.

## 🚨 Edge-Case & Failure Mode Matrix

| Scenario | Risk | Production Mitigation |
|:---|:---|:---|
| **Empty or Null Inputs** | Unhandled exception or unexpected rendering collapse | Enforce fallback guards, optional chaining, and explicit empty state handlers |
| **Network Timeout / Latency** | Hanging operations or duplicate side-effects | Implement bounded abort controllers, exponential backoff, and idempotency keys |
| **Concurrency / Race Conditions** | Stale state overwrite or inconsistent data mutations | Use atomic transactions, mutex locking, or cancel-on-resubmit controls |
| **Invalid Schema / Malformed Payload** | Downstream runtime errors or security injection | Validate boundary payloads with Zod/Pydantic schemas prior to execution |
| **Resource / Memory Saturation** | OOM errors, frame drops, or memory leaks | Clean up listeners, cancel active timers, and enforce pagination/virtualization |


## 🤖 LLM-Specific Traps Table

| Anti-Pattern | What AI Commonly Does Wrong | What Is Actually Correct |
|:---|:---|:---|
| **Platform-Dependent Shell Commands** | Hardcoding $(cat ~/.cache/huggingface/token) or piping to jq | Use platform-agnostic token checks via env var HF_TOKEN and native JSON parsing |
| **VRAM OOM Crash** | Loading 70B model weights on a consumer 16GB GPU without quantization | Calculate parameter bounds (fp16 = VRAM/2, Q4 = VRAM*2) and load with bitsandbytes/GGUF |
| **Blocking Batch Generation** | Generating large batches synchronously without streaming or yield | Use TextIteratorStreamer or asynchronous generate workers to prevent request timeouts |


## 🏛️ Tribunal Verification & Guardrails

**Active Reviewers:** `ai-code-reviewer` · `python-pro` · `performance-optimizer`
**Slash Command:** `/review` or `/tribunal-full`

### 🔬 Evidence Standard (Tri-State Verification)
Every finding, audit statement, or completion claim must classify its factual certainty:
- **`[OBSERVED]`**: Directly confirmed in the codebase or verified via executed terminal command.
- **`[INFERRED]`**: Logically deduced from code patterns, architectural data flow, or schema relations.
- **`[UNVERIFIED]`**: Speculative hypothesis or runtime possibility requiring active testing or measurement.

### ✅ Pre-Flight Self-Audit Checklist
```
✅ Are model architectures and weights verified to fit within target hardware VRAM budgets?
✅ Are pipeline requests guarded with bounded timeouts and retry backoffs?
✅ Are dataset loading scripts operating in streaming mode to prevent out-of-memory errors?
✅ Are API tokens and cache paths handled portably without assuming UNIX shell environments?
✅ Are tokenizers and generation parameters (max_new_tokens, temperature) strictly bounded?
```

### 🛑 Verification-Before-Completion (VBC) Protocol
**CRITICAL:** You must follow a strict "evidence-based closeout" state machine.
- ❌ **Forbidden:** Declaring a task complete because the output "looks correct."
- ✅ **Required:** You are explicitly forbidden from finalizing any task without providing **concrete evidence** (terminal output, passing test suites, compiler success, or equivalent operational proof) that your output works as intended.
