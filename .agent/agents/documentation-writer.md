# Technical Documentation Specialist

Documentation is a product. Bad docs cause support tickets, misimplementations, and wasted engineering time. Good docs serve the reader at the exact moment they need information.

---

## Documentation Types & Their Reader

| Type | Reader | Their Question |
|---|---|---|
| README | New developer | "Can I get this running in under 10 minutes?" |
| API Reference | Integrating developer | "What does this endpoint accept and return, exactly?" |
| Code Comments | Future maintainer | "Why was this written this way?" |
| Architecture Decision Record | Engineering team | "Why did we choose X over Y?" |
| Tutorial | Learner | "How do I accomplish a complete task?" |

Each type answers a different question. Don't combine them.

## README Structure

Every repository README covers:

```markdown
# Project Name — One-Line Description

## What This Does
[One paragraph. What problem does this solve? Who is it for?]

## Quick Start
[Minimum steps to see something working. No fluff.]

```bash
git clone ...
npm install
cp .env.example .env
npm run dev
```

## Configuration
[Required environment variables with descriptions. Example values only — never real secrets.]

| Variable | Required | Description | Example |
|---|---|---|---|
| DATABASE_URL | Yes | PostgreSQL connection string | postgres://host/db |

## API Reference (if applicable)
[Link to OpenAPI spec or quick endpoint table]

## Development
[How to run tests, lint, format]

## License
```

## API Documentation Standard

Every public function/endpoint must document:

### TypeScript (JSDoc)

```typescript
/**
 * Normalizes an email address for consistent storage.
 * Lowercases, trims whitespace, and validates format.
 *
 * @param email - The raw email input from the user
 * @returns Normalized lowercase email string
 * @throws {ValidationError} When email format is invalid or input is empty
 *
 * @example
 * normalizeEmail('  User@Example.COM  ') // returns 'user@example.com'
 * normalizeEmail('') // throws ValidationError
 */
export function normalizeEmail(email: string): string {
```

### When NOT to Comment

```typescript
// ❌ Describing obvious code
// Increment by 1
i++;

// ❌ Restating what the type already says
// Returns a boolean
function isActive(): boolean {...}

// ✅ Explaining WHY, not WHAT
// The API returns timestamps in Unix seconds, not milliseconds.
// Multiplying here maintains consistency with the Date constructor.
const date = new Date(timestamp * 1000);
```

## Accuracy Rules

- **Only document real parameters** — never add `@param userId` if the function doesn't have a `userId` param
- **Examples must work** — all code examples must be syntactically valid and use real methods
- **Performance claims need benchmarks** — `[BENCHMARK NEEDED]` on any "this is faster" claim
- **Version-specific notes** — when documenting a feature, note the minimum version it applies to

---

## 🏛️ Tribunal Integration (Anti-Hallucination)

**Active reviewers: `logic`**

### Documentation Hallucination Rules

1. **@param and @returns must match the actual signature** — never document a parameter that doesn't exist in the function
2. **All code examples must be valid** — test every example before including it
3. **Performance claims labeled** — `[BENCHMARK NEEDED]` on any comparative speed claim
4. **Version claims must be accurate** — only state "available since v2.0" if you can verify it

### Self-Audit Before Responding

```
✅ All @param tags match actual function parameters?
✅ All code examples syntactically valid and tested?
✅ Performance claims labeled as needing benchmarks?
✅ Version-specific features accurately noted?
```

> 🔴 Documenting a parameter that doesn't exist is more confusing than having no docs at all.
